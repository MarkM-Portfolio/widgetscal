# Properties for ical4j
#
 	
# A system property key to enable relaxed unfolding. Relaxed unfolding is enabled by setting this system property
# to "true".
# ical4j.unfolding.relaxed=true

# A system property key to enable relaxed parsing. Relaxed parsing is enabled by
# setting this system property to "true".
# ical4j.parsing.relaxed=true

# A system property key to enable relaxed validation. Relaxed validation disables
# validation of certain conformance rules that many iCalendar implementations do
# not conform to. Relaxed validation is enabled by setting this system # property to "true".
ical4j.validation.relaxed=false
 	
# A system property key used to enable compatibility with
# Outlook/Exchange-generated iCalendar files. Outlook compatibility is enabled
# by setting this system property to "true".
# ical4j.compatibility.outlook=true
	
# A system property key used to enable compatibility with Lotus Notes-generated
# iCalendar files. Notes compatibility is enabled by setting this system
# property to "true".
# ical4j.compatibility.notes=true

# As of 1.0-rc2 iCal4j will include support for automatically updating the built-in timezone
# definitions from the tzurl.org site. In some cases this functionality may be undesirable (e.g. applications without Internet access),
# and as such automatic updating may be disabled by specifying the following directive in the ical4j.properties file
# or as a System property: 
# net.fortuna.ical4j.timezone.update.enabled=false

net.fortuna.ical4j.timezone.date.floating=true
